# Like exercise 3, this also uses the make_shirt() function, but this already has size and text given

def make_shirt(size= "L", text= "I love Python."):
    print("This shirt is size: " + size + " and '" + text + "' is printed on it.")

make_shirt()

make_shirt(size= "M") # Changes the value in size

make_shirt(text="VALORANT", size="XXXXXXXXL") # changes the whole statement
